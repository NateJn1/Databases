# Databases
For CSE 3241 at The Ohio State University.

Part 1:
The project is for creating a database for Smilow Dentristy for Dr. Hope Smilow's dental practice. 
We were asked to go through a phase of researching to create an enhanced entity relationship diagram and to create a small sample data.
All of which is available in Part 1.

Part 2:
We had to revise our diagram from critiques given from TAs and the professor. From there, we used the diagram to create a relational schema in sentence notation.
From there, we created some examples of relational algebra in practice using out relational schema, and created a specification sheet to show meta-data about each attribute in the schema.
