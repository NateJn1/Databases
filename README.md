# Databases
For CSE 3241 at The Ohio State University.

The first 3 parts are just going over the steps taken throughout the semester.

Part 4 is the final result showing our creation of a database from scratch. First creating an entity relationship diagram, creating a relational schema, and creating functional SQL code for the relational schema.
