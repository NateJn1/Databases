# Databases
For CSE 3241 at The Ohio State University.

The first 3 parts are just going over the steps taken throughout the semester. These steps include researching about the company we are creating a database for, Smilow Dentistry. After we researched what the company wanted, we created an enhanced entity relationship diagram, craeting a relational schema, normalizing our schema, creating SQL code for the schema, and test running our SQL database with sample data and queries.

Part 4 is the final result showing our creation of a database from scratch. First creating an entity relationship diagram, creating a relational schema, and creating functional SQL code for the relational schema.
